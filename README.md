# üíª My macOS Setup Script

This repository contains a set of scripts to automate the setup of a new macOS machine for development. It installs applications, development tools, and configures the Zsh shell with Powerlevel10k.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Start

This script is personalized for my workflow. It will install specific applications and overwrite existing configuration files (like `.zshrc`) or just use mine that I have added for now.

**It is strongly recommended that you fork this repository and customize the scripts to fit your own needs.**

* Review and edit the packages in `modules/1_homebrew.sh` and `modules/2_applications.sh`.
* Customize your shell configuration in `config/zshrc`.
