## The Closest Alternative: Scriptable Virtualization

While you can't use Docker, you can achieve a similar automated, command-line-driven workflow using a Virtual Machine (VM). This gives you the full, isolated macOS environment you need for accurate testing, with the scriptability you're looking for from a Dockerized approach.

The best tool for this on modern Macs is UTM, because it can be fully controlled from the command line via its utmctl tool.

Here’s how you can create a "Docker-like" testing workflow using UTM:

1. The "Image": A Base macOS Install

Your "base image" is a fresh macOS installer file (an .ipsw file). You create a clean, master VM from this file. This is equivalent to your ubuntu:latest or other base image in Docker.

2. The "Dockerfile": A VM Creation Script

You can write a shell script that uses utmctl to create, configure, and manage your testing VM. This is the equivalent of your Dockerfile.

3. The "docker run": An Automated Test Script

You can create a run_tests.sh script that automates the entire testing lifecycle, giving you that one-command testing capability.

Here’s what that script would do:

Clone the VM: Instead of starting from scratch every time, you can have a "clean" master VM and create a clone for each test run. This is incredibly fast.

Bash
utmctl clone "macOS-clean" --name "macOS-test-run"
Start the Test VM:

Bash
utmctl start "macOS-test-run"
Copy and Execute the Script: Once the VM is running, you'd copy your setup repository into it (using ssh or scp) and execute the setup.sh script remotely.

(Note: This requires enabling "Remote Login" in the VM's System Settings first.)

Bash
# Wait for VM to boot and get IP address...
scp -r . user@vm_ip:~/
ssh user@vm_ip "./macBook_setup/setup.sh"
Stop and Delete: After the test is complete, you can stop and delete the cloned VM, leaving your clean master untouched.

Bash
utmctl stop "macOS-test-run"
utmctl delete "macOS-test-run"
In summary, while you can't use Docker itself, you can adopt a Docker-like philosophy of automated, disposable environments by scripting a Virtual Machine, which is the correct tool for this specific job.
